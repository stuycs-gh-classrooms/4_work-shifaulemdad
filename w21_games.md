#Hello, we (Samid, Shifaul, August) are doing Breakout!
#
###Purpose: destroy all blocks on screen, without losing all lives.
###Player control: Paddle at the bottom of the screen reflects a ball.
###Computer control: The ball flies around, and blocks disappear when hit.
###Control: the Player uses the mouse to change the paddle X-value.
###Computer behavior: The ball bounces predictably along borders and blocks, and unpredictably off of the paddle. It speeds up after hitting farther blocks.
###Classes: Ball, Paddle, Blocks.
### I would use a 2D array for block objects.
